### \[STEP 1: GENERATE DATA + CHARTS FOR LLM STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT]

#### A. Token Efficiency: Structured vs. Unstructured (Simulated Data)

| Sample Set            | Mean Token Count | Std Dev | Pass/Fail Structure (%) |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| Legacy (Unstructured) | 243              | 37      | 12%                     |
| MAXX-R1 (Structured)  | 179              | 22      | 100%                    |

#### B. Modular Memory Recall Speed (ms)

| System Version  | Median Recall (ms) | Error Rate (%) |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Legacy Flat     | 94                 | 4.8            |
| MAXX-R1 Modular | 47                 | 0.7            |

#### C. AGI Formula Impact Example

If L=0.95, M=0.92, Q=0.98, B=1, H=1, P=1 (normalized 0–1 scale):

$$
\text{AGI\_Score} = \frac{L \times M \times Q}{B + H + P}
= \frac{0.95 \times 0.92 \times 0.98}{1 + 1 + 1}
= \frac{0.856}{3}
= 0.285
$$

#### D. Security/Privacy Check Pass Rate

| Metric         | MAXX-R1 | Baseline LLM |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Security Check | 99.4%   | 87.2%        |
| Privacy Check  | 99.1%   | 86.7%        |

#### \[STEP 3: EMBEDDED USE CASE SCENARIOS]

**Use Case 1:** *Deterministic Logic, Memory, Security*

* Inputs: L=0.91, M=0.87, Q=0.95, B=1, H=1, P=1
* $$
  $$

]

* Result: System passes all security checks (Q>0.9), response structure validated (100%), output approved.

**Use Case 2:** *Security Breach Attempt*

* Inputs: L=0.94, M=0.93, Q=0.72, B=2, H=1, P=1
* $$
  $$

AGI = \frac{0.94 \times 0.93 \times 0.72}{4} = 0.156
]

* Result: Security below threshold (Q<0.80) triggers block and audit log, output suppressed.

**Use Case 3:** *Memory Module Degradation*

* Inputs: L=0.90, M=0.60, Q=0.96, B=1, H=1, P=1
* $$
  $$

AGI = \frac{0.90 \times 0.60 \times 0.96}{3} = 0.173
]

* Result: Self-repair module (W) initiates block recovery, re-runs memory integrity checks.
